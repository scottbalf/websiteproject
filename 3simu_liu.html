    <p style="text-align:center">Now let me tell you about Simu Liu; he's a certified snack and it is lunch time! He's so f-wording handsome I think someone needs turn up the <br>air conditioning because it's getting hot in here and I want to take off all my clothes! Simu looks like he's the most tender, kind, considerate gentleman <br>you could ever meet but he could also rip your throat out in a second, and that gets me going.

        <p style="text-align:center">He's not even just hot though... He's the kind of hot that makes me think monogamy might not actually just be a patriarchal heteronormative trap meant to <br>control people enforced by archaic and oppressive religious regimes, you know? He makes me want the white picket fence.</p>
