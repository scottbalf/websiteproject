    <p style="text-align:center">Yes, I know there are two men here, however I couldn't decide on one and this is my website and you're not my mum so I can do what I want. <br>This is the only double feature though, promise.
    <br><br>Kit Harrington, the delicious Game of Thrones hottie, plays Dane Whitman in Eternals. Kit doesn't play one of the Eternals, but he is dating one of them and his character <br>will eventually go on to play The Black Knight within the MCU so watch this space or you'll get cut with the ebony blade, eowwwww. He is on this list because he is FIT.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Richard Madden IS an Eternal. The hottest of the Eternals menfolk, in my opinion. He plays Icarus, who inspired the story <br>of his namesake who flew too close to the sun. In the movie Icarus gets his ass beat and then flies right into the sun, which is very crybaby dramatic <br>if you ask me, so we are unsure if this is him ixnayed or if he will feature in future movies that the Eternals are included in. He is, in any case, very sexy.</p>
