    <p style="text-align:center">Chris Evans is the leader of the Avengers and almost the leader of my thirst. Over the course of his tenure within the MCU this absolute babe has transitioned <br>from "I'll have your daughter or gay son home by 10pm, sir" to "From now on you call me 'Daddy'" and it has been a beautiful journey to go on. <br>The audible gasp that was heard throughout cinemas worldwide when the chamber in Captain America's first outing opened and he was all buff and sweaty <br>will never be forgotten. Hayley Atwell's unconscious thought to reach out and touch the boob was fully justified, because same, hun.
